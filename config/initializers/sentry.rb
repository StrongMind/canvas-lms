# This initializer is for the Sentry exception tracking system.

# "Sentry" is the ruby library that is the client to sentry, and it's
# config file would be "config/sentry.yml". If that config doesn't exist,
# nothing happens.  If it *does*, we register a callback with Canvas::Errors
# so that every time an exception is reported, we can fire off a sentry
# call to track it and aggregate it for us.

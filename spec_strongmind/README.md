    STRONGMIND_SPEC=1 bundle                                 # make sure your StrongMind bundle is setup

### You can get faster test runs using Spring
Use **bin/rspec** instead of **bundle exec rspec**

Warning! For some unknown reason Feature specs hang with bin/rspec.
So make sure you filter the
specs you run with it.
